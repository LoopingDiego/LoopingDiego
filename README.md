### Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my projects, this is my little codecrafting site. Currently i'm a Holberton Student so you may see a lot of related repositories here; as they are my path for being a great software developer ðŸŒ± i'll keep the code just like the first time i made it.

By now i'm getting my skills polished with JetBrains projects ðŸ‘¯ (python & Java) and in the free-time i read variadic topic from DC comics facts to ðŸ”­physics(no a lot of maths, just dreaming theories)

I enjoy moving on a lot of things so before coding i studied graphic design for almost three years and after that i got a bachelor in bussiness management.
